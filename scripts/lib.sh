# dnsbl_verdict <ip> — ask the blocklists what they make of an address, and print one
# line naming both the verdict and the list that gave it:

#   listed <zone> <answer>   that list has the address

# is the list that matters for deliverability and it refuses to answer any resolver
# serving more than one machine, which is this box's system resolver, a workstation's
# and every public resolver tried on 2026-09-23. A refusal is 127.255.255.x and a
# listing is 127.0.0.x, so the old code reported "cannot check" and "clean" in the same
# breath, and mailed the first of those every cooldown. The zones below are ordered
# strongest first, the first to answer wins, and the verdict names it, because a
# listing on SpamCop is not a listing on Spamhaus and the reader needs to know which.
